# EXCEL-PROJECT-Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Project
## Introduction
Hotel businesses rely heavily on data analysis to optimize performance, reduce cancellations, and improve guest satisfaction. This project 
analyzes hotel bookings based on key metrics such as:

Guest types (family, single, and two adults),
Booking correctness,
Monthly booking trends, and
Booking cancellations by hotel type (City vs Resort).
The dataset contains 21,996 total bookings, out of which 8,142 were canceled. 

## The analysis aims to:
Identify booking trends,
Compare hotel performance, and
Provide actionable insights to minimize cancellations.
## Objectives
Analyze booking trends across guest types.
Examine booking accuracy and its relation to cancellations.
Study seasonal trends for bookings and cancellations.
Compare City Hotel and Resort Hotel performance.
Provide strategies to reduce cancellations and improve revenue.
